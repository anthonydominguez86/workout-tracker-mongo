# The Assignment: Workout Tracker
An Application to track your daily workouts. 
The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
 
The assignment allowed us to gain experience using MongoDB and mongoose we were given starter code and had to create the backend routes, models, and server.js. Previously we had done a very similar assignment using MySQL but Mongo is very different since it is much easier to work with. It did not have the errors or issues that were encountered when using MySQL which at some points was very frustrating. The application as stated above allows the user to add in a workout based on Cardio or Resistance and once that is chosen a new set of prompts asking the user the time, duration, reps, etc based on the workouts. The user can add the exercise and keep going to add more or they will be able to complete the workout. Then the user can access the stats page which allows them to look at the past seven workouts on a graph that shows the statistics of there past workouts. 

# Lessons: 
This assignment taught a lot about the MongoDB and it use in the real world it does seem much easier to use but with that ease could be the ability to have mistakes in the DB. It was another backend assignment since the front end was already built for us. I have been enjoying these backend assignments much more than the front end because when an error occurs it can be diagnosed in a much easier way either through the console or with a console.log on a function. This class has shown me a lot and i have really enjoyed what I have learned so far. Now I can add one more language to my portfolio as I have learned so many in the past months. 

# Takeaways:
I am taking away an overall conception of what I have learned so far. This class has been very stressful and at some points I think we all have though well maybe we should give up. But since we have now completed two projects and moved onto other things I am looking back at all of the months and noticing all that was taught to us and all that we comprehended. This assignment was just another step closer to becoming a fully employed web developer. I am very happy to have had such a dynamic curriculum because I know out in the real world and in a job setting learning such a multitude of subjects will not always be the case unless studied on our own. I am taking away a new found appreciation of my hard work and gratitude for my instructional team.
